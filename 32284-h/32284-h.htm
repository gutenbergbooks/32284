<h1>The Hitch Hikers</h1>

<p class="blurb"><i>The Rell, a great and ancient Martian race, faced extinction
when all moisture was swept from their planet.<br
 />Then, one day, a lone visitor&mdash;a strange, two-legged creature
composed mostly of water&mdash;landed on Mars&nbsp;&hellip;</i></p>

<p class="author">BY VERNON L. MC CAIN</p>

<p class="noindent tb"><br class="ns"
 /><span class="drop">T</span><span class="uc">he dehydration</span> of the
planet had taken centuries in
all. The Rell had still been a great
race when the process started. Construction
of the canals was a prodigious
feat but not a truly remarkable
one. But what use are even
canals when there is nothing to fill
them?</p>

<p>What cosmic influences might
have caused the disaster baffled
even the group-mind of the Rell.
Through the eons the atmosphere
had drifted into space; and with it
went the life-giving moisture. Originally
a liquid paradise, the planet
was now a dry, hostile husk.</p>

<p>The large groups of Rell had
been the first to suffer. But in time
even the tiny villages containing
mere quadrillions of the submicroscopic<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original reads "sub-microscopic" -->
entities had found too little
moisture left to satisfy their thirst
and the journey ever southward toward
the pole had commenced.</p>

<p>The new life was bitter and difficult
and as their resources were
depleted so also did their numbers
diminish.</p>

<div class="illus">
<p class="ctr"><a name="png.002" id="png.002" href="#png.002"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-002.png" width="438" height="665"
 alt="Astronaut and spaceship on surface of planet" title="" /></p>
</div>

<p>Huddled at their last retreat the
Rell watched the ever smaller ice
cap annually diminish and lived
with the knowledge they faced extinction.
A mere thousand years
<a name="png.003" id="png.003" href="#png.003"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>more would see even this trifling
remainder gone.</p>

<p>Oh, you might say there was
hope &hellip; of a sort. There might be
Rell in the northern hemisphere.
The canals girdled the globe and
a similar ice cap could well exist
at the opposite pole. Rell perhaps
survived there also.</p>

<p>But this was scant comfort. The
fate of the Rell in the South was
sealed. What hope of any brighter
future for those in the North? And
if they survived a few hundred
thousand years longer &hellip; or if
they had perished a similar period
earlier, what actual difference did
it make?</p>

<p>There was no one more aware
of this gloomy future than Raeillo/ee13.</p>

<p>In the old days a single unit of
the group-mind of the Rell would
have possessed but a single function
and exercised this function
perhaps a dozen times during his
life. But due to the inexorable
shrinkage only the most important
problems now could command
mind-action and each unit had
been forced to forsake specialization
for multi-purpose endeavors.</p>

<p>Thus Raeillo/ee13 and his mate
Raellu//2 were two of the five
thousand units whose task was to
multiply in any group-mind action
involving mathematical prediction.
Naturally Raeillo/ee13 and Raellu//2
did not waste their abilities
in mundane problems not involving
prediction. Nor did they
divide, add, or subtract. That was
assigned to other units just as
several million of the upper groups
had the task of sorting and interpreting
their results. Raeillo/ee13
and Raellu//2 multiplied
only. And it must be admitted
they did it very well. It is a pity
the Rell could not have multiplied
physically as easily as Raeillo/ee13
and Raellu//2 multiplied mentally.</p>

<p>With the exception of an occasional
comet or meteor the Rell
were seldom diverted by anything
of a physical nature. The ice cap
was their sole concern.</p>

<p>But one afternoon a rare physical
phenomenon was reported by a
bank of observer Rell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the sky&#8217;s northwest portion,&rdquo;
an excited injunction came
through. &ldquo;Observe that patch of
flaming red!&rdquo;</p>

<p>More observer Rell were quickly
focused on the novel sight and further
data was rapidly fed into the
interpretive bank.</p>

<p>The Rell were justifiably proud
of their interpreters. With the race
shrinkage it had proved impossible
to properly train new interpreters.
So, not without a great deal of
sacrifice, the old interpreters, dating
back to when the canals still flowed
with water, had been kept alive.</p>

<p>They were incredibly ancient but
there was no doubt as to their
ability. It was a truism among the
Rell that the interpretive banks arrived
at their conclusions faster
than any other group and that these
conclusions could be checked to
hundreds of decimal places without
finding inaccuracy.</p>

<p>So it was no surprise to have the
interpretive bank respond almost
instantly, &ldquo;It is quite odd but the
flame appears to be of artificial
origin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Artificial!&rdquo; came the rough and
questing probe of the speculative
bank. &ldquo;But how could Rell possibly
be out there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.004" id="png.004" href="#png.004"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>&ldquo;Who mentioned Rell?&rdquo; was the
interpretive bank&#8217;s smug answer.
They were not utterly averse to
demonstrating their superior mental
abilities on occasion.</p>

<p>The speculative bank replied,
&ldquo;Artificial implies intelligence, and
intelligence means Rell&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo; the interpretive bank
interrupted. The speculative
bank waited but the interpretive
bank failed to enlarge on the provocative
query.</p>

<p>The Rell had found certain disadvantages
accrued to abnormal
prolongation of life and thus were
not unused to the interpretive
bank&#8217;s occasional tendency to talk
in riddles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original lacks comma -->,&rdquo; the speculative
bank replied after a quick check
with the logical formulae held in
reserve by the historical bank. &ldquo;It
is theoretically possible that Rell-like
individuals might have developed
elsewhere, and perhaps
even have developed intelligence,
although, according to the historical
bank, such an idea has never
before been subjected to consideration.
But what is the flame doing?&rdquo;
they continued, a trifle resentful at
having been left to do work properly
in the interpretive bank&#8217;s province.</p>

<p>The observation and interpretive
banks once more came into
play, studying the situation for
several minutes. &ldquo;The flame appears
to be the exhaust of a fairly
crude vessel,&rdquo; the interpretive bank
finally reported, &ldquo;propelled by ignition
of some gaseous mixture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it moving?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite rapidly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This called into play the prophecy
division of the mind and
Raeillo/ee13 and Raellu//2, who
had been merely interested onlookers
before, hurriedly meshed
themselves with the other forty
nine hundred odd of their fellows.
(It was impossible to say at any
given time just how many there
were in their computer section, as
several births and deaths had occurred<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original reads "occured" -->
among the group since beginning
the current observations.
These would be suspended for the
next several moments, however, as
there was a strict prohibition
against anyone being born, dying,
or otherwise engaging in extraneous
activity while their particular
bank was either alerted or in action.)</p>

<p>Raeillo/ee13 and Raellu//2 felt
the group discipline take hold much
more firmly than the free-and-easy
mesh which each unit enjoyed
with the complete group-mind
during periods of leisure.</p>

<p>With a speed that would have
been dizzying and incomprehensible
to any individual unit, the observing
banks relayed huge masses of
extraneous data to the interpretive
bank. They strained out the salient
facts and in turn passed these to
the computing:prediction section.
Here they were routed to the
groups who would deal with them.
Raeillo/ee13 and Raellu//2 found
their own talents pressed into service
a dozen or more times in the
space of the minute and a half it
took the computing:prediction and
interpretive banks to arrive at the
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s aimed here,&rdquo; the interpretive
bank reported.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; a jumble of incoherent
and anarchistic thoughts resounded
<a name="png.005" id="png.005" href="#png.005"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>from many shocked and temporarily
out-of-mesh units.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Order!&rdquo; came a sharp command
from the elite corp of three
thousand disciplinary units.</p>

<p>As stillness settled back over the
group-mind the speculative bank
once more came in. &ldquo;By here &hellip;
do you mean <em>right</em> here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Approximately<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original has period -->,&rdquo; replied the
interpretive bank with what would
have sounded suspiciously like a
chuckle in a human reply. &ldquo;According
to calculations the craft
should land within half a mile of
our present location.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&#8217;s go there then and wait for
it!&rdquo; That thought from the now
seldom used reservation of impulse.</p>

<p>The speculative bank murmured,
&ldquo;I wonder if there would be any
danger. How hot is that exhaust?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calculations were rapidly made
and the answer arrived at. The Rell
prudently decided to remain where
they were for the present.</p>


<p class="noindent tb"><br class="ns"
 /><span class="drop">C</span><span class="uc">aptain Leonard Brown</span>,
USAF, hunched over the instruments
in the cramped control
cabin which, being the only available
space in the ship, doubled as
living quarters. A larger man would
have found the arrangement impossible.
Brown, being 5'&nbsp;2" and
weighing 105 pounds found it
merely intolerable.</p>

<p>At the moment he was temporarily
able to forget his discomfort,
however. The many tiny dials and
indicators told a story all their own
to Brown&#8217;s trained vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just another half hour,&rdquo; he
whispered to himself. &ldquo;Just thirty
more minutes and I&#8217;ll land. It may
be just a dead planet but I&#8217;ll still
be the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There really wasn&#8217;t a great deal
for Brown to do. The ship was self-guided.
The Air Force had trusted
robot mechanisms more than human
reactions.</p>

<p>Thus Brown&#8217;s entire active contribution
to the flight consisted in
watching the dials (which recorded
everything so even watching them
was unnecessary) and in pressing
the button which would cause the
ship to start its return journey.</p>

<p>Of course the scientists could
have constructed another mechanism
to press the button and made
it a completely robot ship. But despite
their frailties and imperfections,
human beings have certain
advantages. Humans can talk.
Machines may see and detect far
more than their human creators
but all they can do is record. They
can neither interpret nor satisfactorily
describe.</p>

<p>Brown was present not only to
report a human&#8217;s reactions to the
first Mars flight; he was also along
to see that which the machines
might miss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve never satisfactorily defined
life,&rdquo; one of his instructors
had told Brown shortly after he
started the three grueling years of
training which had been necessary,
&ldquo;so we can&#8217;t very well build a foolproof
machine for detecting it.
That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve left room for 105
pounds of dead weight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&#8217;m your foolproof machine
for detecting life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re the closest we
can come to it at present. We&#8217;re
banking everything on this first
trip. It&#8217;ll be at least eighteen
<a name="png.006" id="png.006" href="#png.006"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>months later before we can get a
second ship into space. So it&#8217;s up
to you to get everything you can
&hellip; some evidence of life, preferably
animal, if possible. With public
support it&#8217;ll be a hell of a lot
easier squeezing appropriations out
of Congress for the next ship and
to get public support we need the
biggest possible play in the newspapers.
If anything is newsworthy
on Mars it should be evidence of
life &hellip; even plant life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So here he was, 105 pounds of
concentrated knowledge and anticipation,
itching with the desire for
action and also from more basic
causes having to do with two
months confinement in a small
space with a minimum of water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life is most probable at the
poles<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original has period -->,&rdquo; the instructor had said.
&ldquo;You won&#8217;t be able to stay long so
we&#8217;ll try to set you down right at
the South Pole. You won&#8217;t have
room to bring back specimens. So
keep your eyes open and absorb
everything you see. Don&#8217;t forget
anything. What you bring back in
your mind weighs nothing.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />&ldquo;It&#8217;s just sitting there,&rdquo; the observing
banks reported, &ldquo;and the
red flame has gone out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it safe now?&rdquo; enquired the
speculative bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it safe to go near that thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s very huge,&rdquo; ventured the
observing banks unasked. There
was a stir of activity which encompassed
practically all except
the most simple units and which
lasted for perhaps five minutes
while the speculative bank&#8217;s last
question was processed.</p>

<p>Finally the interpretive bank reluctantly
admitted, &ldquo;We can&#8217;t arrive
at a positive answer. Too many
unknown elements are present. We
don&#8217;t know for sure what caused
the flame, when it might start
again, or what, if anything, is inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said it was a work of
intelligence. Doesn&#8217;t that mean
Rell would be inside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. They could
have constructed the thing to operate
itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was just then that the observing
banks reported, &ldquo;It&#8217;s opening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speculative bank quickly
responded, &ldquo;This is an emergency.
We must be able to observe from
close up. We&#8217;ll have to approach
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The entire mind?&rdquo; enquired
the disciplinary corps.</p>

<p>The speculative bank hesitated.
&ldquo;No, we&#8217;ll need to split up. One-fifth
of us will go, the rest remain
here. It&#8217;s a short distance and
we&#8217;ll still be able to continue in
complete contact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who were to go were
quickly sorted out and Raeillo/ee13
was quite thrilled to find he and
Raellu//2 were included in the
scouting party.</p>

<p>The group set off briskly toward
their objective but had moved
hardly one hundred yards when a
vertigo seemed to overtake them.
Raeillo/ee13 found himself swimming
helplessly in a vortex of darkness
and isolation, blanked off from
not only the group-mind and his
bank but also from Raellu//2.
Frantically he grasped for some sort
of stasis, but dependence on the
group-mind was too ingrained and
he was unable to stir his
<a name="png.007" id="png.007" href="#png.007"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>long-dormant powers of sight and education.</p>

<p>Then the isolation cleared to be
replaced by a brief impression of
chaos with perhaps a tinge of
alienness. Another instant of vertigo
followed and then everything
was normal once more as the comfortable
familiar mesh took hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Even the
speculative bank sounded frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; The usually silent meshing
bank sounded abashed. &ldquo;We
weren&#8217;t prepared for that. Some
sort of thought wave is issuing from
the opening and it disrupted the
group mesh till we were able to
take it into calculation and rebuild
the mesh around it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought wave? Then there <em>are</em>
Rell in that thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not compute before the
mesh is set<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original has period -->,&rdquo; the interpretive bank
cautioned. &ldquo;The presence of Rell,
while extremely probable, is not
yet entirely certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting for a suggestion
from elsewhere the disciplinary
group ordered the entire mind forward.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in time of stress, dormant
qualities tend to emerge,
Raeillo/ee13 mused. Certainly
everyone, himself included, appeared
to be exercising speculative
qualities. Not that specialization
isn&#8217;t a marvelous blessing, he
hastily added, in case the disciplinary
corps might be scanning his
bank. But the disciplinary corps
itself was as fascinated by the phenomenon
ahead as Raeillo/ee13.</p>

<p>Emerging from the infinitely
huge upright thing was a mobile
being, also infinitely huge. Not that
they were the same size. The mobile
one was small enough to fit easily
through the opening in the lower
portion of the larger. But beyond
a certain point words lose meaning
and infinitely huge was the closest
measurement the tiny Rell could
find for either the upright pointed
thing or the knobby one which had
emerged and was quickly identified
as the source of the disrupting
thought patterns.</p>


<p class="noindent tb"><br class="ns"
 /><span class="drop">L</span><span class="uc">eonard Brown</span> was enjoying
himself thoroughly. The inside
of a space suit can scarcely be
termed comfortable but at least you
can move around in it and Brown
was making the most of this sensation
after two months cramped in
his tiny cell. He was, in fact, comporting
himself much as a three-year-old
might have done after a
similar release.</p>

<p>But before long he settled down
to the serious business of observing
and mentally recording everything
in sight.</p>

<p>There were none of the mysterious
&lsquo;canals&rsquo; in view, which was
disappointing; one piece of glamour
the publicity boys would necessarily
forego until the next trip. The ice
cap itself, if such it could be called,
was almost equally disappointing.
On Earth it would have been dismissed
as a mere frost patch, if this
section was typical. For a radius of
many yards the ground was blasted
bare by the action of the exhaust
and nowhere in sight did there appear
to be more than the flimsiest
covering of white over the brown
sandy soil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even lichens,&rdquo; muttered
Brown in disgust.</p>

<p>But disgust cannot long stand
<a name="png.008" id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>against the magic of a fresh new
planet and Brown continued his
avid, though barren, search until
hunger forced his return to the
ship. He had been able to detect
no life and was completely unaware
of his close proximity to the
planet&#8217;s dominant species. It had
been considered neither practical
nor particularly desirable to build
a microscope into the space suit.
Simplicity and the least possible
weight had been the watchwords
here as with everything designed
to go aboard the ship.</p>

<p>In any case, a microscope would
have done Brown little good in
trying to detect the submicroscopic
beings of the Rell.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The Rell, who had somewhat
lost their fear of Brown, hastily retreated
when they saw him returning
to the still awesome ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you <em>sure</em> he&#8217;s <em>completely</em>
self-powered?&rdquo; the speculative bank
queried. &ldquo;No Rell inside him at
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many Rell-like beings
in various parts of him<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original has period -->,&rdquo; replied
the interpretive bank. &ldquo;Some help
digest his food, others are predators,
and still others their enemies.
But most are too big and
clumsy to have developed intelligence,
and even the small ones
appear completely mindless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where do the thought
waves come from? We all felt
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s hard to accept but we are
almost forced to conclude they are
emanating from the mobile unit
itself, or rather from the living part
within the cocoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re positive they aren&#8217;t the
product of some of the Rell-beings
inside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost positive. The mesh insists
not. In fact, it claims this is
an un-Rell like type of intelligence,
though that appears to be a contradiction
in terms. The thought
pattern is completely outside our
experience. In fact, it is so alien
we haven&#8217;t broken it down yet to
the meaning behind it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if the Rell inside are too
large to have developed intelligence,
how could this gigantic
monster in which they live have
done so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot yet say. Remember,
the theory that intelligence cannot
develop in creatures above a certain
size is unproven, even though
never before challenged. We&#8217;ve
watched other races die through
failure to adapt to change so apparently
it is true of Rell-like
creatures on this world. But who
can say about organisms on another
world or of the unprecedented
size of this one? Completely different
physical laws may apply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was later that afternoon after
the Rell had spent much time observing
Brown while Brown was
busy observing the landscape that
the interpretive bank made the
triumphant announcement, &ldquo;We
have it! We&#8217;ve broken the thought
waves down to their meanings and
know what he&#8217;s thinking. What
would you like to know first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Check and see if there are any
Rell inside the other thing or on
his home world. They might have
constructed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently there are none, or at
least no intelligent Rell, on his
world. We can&#8217;t guide his mind
but the memory bank recorded all
<a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>the thoughts we&#8217;ve received and
some time ago he was thinking of
something he termed &lsquo;vermin&rsquo;.
Apparently these are sometimes
Rell-like creatures, although far
larger. He regards them as a great
nuisance, but mindless. The big
thing, by the way, he calls a &lsquo;ship&rsquo;
and it is utterly lifeless. We needn&#8217;t
fear the flame until this creature
leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about him? What is he
like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s the most exciting part!
He thought of his bodily needs once
and we glimpsed<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original reads "glimsed" --> a concept dealing
with his physical construction. It&#8217;s
incredible! His body is composed
almost entirely of water &hellip; there&#8217;s
enough water in him alone to
prolong the life of the Rell many
ages. Further, the air in his &lsquo;ship&rsquo;
is heavily impregnated with moisture
and he even has reserve supplies
of water for his needs.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />At this, not only Raeillo/ee13,
but all except perhaps the most
responsible units felt a shiver of
primitive longing and perhaps even
greed. Not for millennia<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original reads "millenia" --> had there
been such a plentitude of water so
close!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then can&#8217;t we appropriate at
least part of it?&rdquo; asked the speculative
bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately both the &lsquo;man&rsquo;,
as he calls himself, and his &lsquo;ship&rsquo;
are sealed so tightly that we could
not penetrate either. Worse yet,
almost half his time here is already
gone. We don&#8217;t quite understand
his purpose here. His thoughts seem
to say he is searching for Rell for
some unfathomable reason yet he
seems to know nothing of the Rell
and cannot even detect us.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="noindent tb"><br class="ns"
 /><span class="drop">I</span><span class="uc">t was</span> the next day when the
time was almost all gone that
the two big discoveries were made.
During a routine check, the mesh
came across a thought of the man&#8217;s
return and a visualization of his
home world. It was so startling
that the interpretive bank was recalled
from its effort to try to devise
a means through the spacesuit
and set at the new problem.</p>

<p>A hasty check of the man&#8217;s subconscious
thoughts revealed the big
news. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; the interpretive
bank announced, &ldquo;not only
does this being&#8217;s home world have
a moist atmosphere like that in his
ship but two thirds of the surface
of his world is <em>liquid water</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even the speculative bank was
silent for a full two seconds after
this news. Then a hasty impulse
was sent to the disciplinary corps
and the entire mind called into
action. An extreme emergency upon
which the fate of the race hinged
called for the utmost effort by even
the humblest members of the
group.</p>

<p>The Rell worked diligently and
many blind alleys were explored,
but it was not for some time that
anyone thought of enquiring of the
not-too-bright feeding bank how
they were managing to keep the
mind operating at considerably
more than normal power with no
frost within feeding distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re taking moisture from the
air<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original has period -->,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the moisture coming
from?&rdquo; the interpretive bank was
asked.</p>

<p>The answer didn&#8217;t take long.
Rapid measurements supplied it.
&ldquo;Some of it is vaporized frost but
that wouldn&#8217;t be enough for our
<a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>needs. The only other possibility is
that moisture must be seeping
away from either the man or his
ship despite his sureness that they
were both airtight and our own
investigations which confirmed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had maintained a cautious
distance from the ship for the most
part despite the interpretive bank&#8217;s
assurance of no immediate danger.
But now they swarmed over both
it and the spacesuit determined to
detect the leak.</p>

<p>They found none.</p>

<p>And now the man was returning
to his ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the last time<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original has period -->,&rdquo; the mesh
warned. It was now or never.</p>

<p>For a second there was conflict
over control of the circuits to the
disciplinary corps which carried
with it command of the organism
during the emergency. The speculative
bank customarily assumed
this responsibility, but a slight
schism had developed between
it and the interpretive bank.
The latter&#8217;s greater age and skill
came into play and victory was
quickly won.</p>

<p>From the disciplinary corps came
the order, &ldquo;Stay close to the &lsquo;man&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interpretive bank explained,
&ldquo;He breathes the air so he&#8217;ll have
to get to it some way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The defeated speculative bank
maintained a sulky silence.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the entire mind
of the Rell rode into the interior
of the ship through the airlock
while clustered around Brown.</p>

<p>The Rell had grasped that the
man lived and traveled inside his
ship and the necessity for it to be
airtight<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original reads "air tight" -->. But so desperate were the
two races&#8217; needs that the necessity
for an airlock and the consequent
slight seepage each time it was used
had not occurred<!-- Transcriber's note:
 original reads "occured" --> to even the interpretive
bank.</p>

<p>Inside, many Rell, suddenly intoxicated
by the heady moisture-laden
air, commenced uniting with
each other then splitting away, each
such union resulting in another unit
of Rell, naturally. The interpretive
bank again seized control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop it! Stop it this instant!&rdquo;
it snapped. &ldquo;Reproduction must be
kept to the former minimum for
now. That is a firm order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reluctantly the process was
halted. The interpretive bank explained,
&ldquo;It would not take long
for us to use up the entire supply of
water if we indulged in uncontrolled
reproduction. That might endanger
the whole trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; the
speculative bank finally asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no way of knowing
positively whether the man uses
this same atmosphere until he returns
to his world or not. For our
own safety it would seem best, since
Rell-like creatures already inhabit
him, that we join them. If any
place is safe it will be his interior.
And there is plenty of moisture
within to sustain us. But we must be
good parasites,&rdquo; the interpretive
bank warned. &ldquo;Remember, no undue
reproduction no matter how
many quarts of moisture seem to be
going to waste inside this &lsquo;man&rsquo;.
He may need it himself and if he
does not survive the ship might
not complete its trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brown was just emerging from
his space suit so the Rell chose his
closest available body opening and
flowed as a group into his mouth
and nostrils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahchoo!&rdquo; sneezed Brown,
<a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">96</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>violently evicting half the Rell.</p>

<p>They re-entered a bit more cautiously
in order not to irritate the
sensitive membrane again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dammit,&rdquo; said Brown, &ldquo;don&#8217;t
tell me I&#8217;ve caught a cold clear out
here on Mars. Hope I didn&#8217;t pick
up any Martian germs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he needn&#8217;t have worried. By
the time he reached Earth he was
far less germ-ridden, even if considerably
more itchy on the exterior,
than when he&#8217;d left. The
Rell were good at self defense and a
surprising number of mindless but
voracious creatures in Brown&#8217;s interior
had been eliminated.</p>

<p>Brown dreaded having to give
the news he carried but he needn&#8217;t
have. He was a conquering hero.</p>

<p>So much fuss was made over the
first flight to Mars that Congress
promptly voted twice the appropriation
for the second ship that
the Air Force had requested, despite
strong opposition from the Navy
and headlines which read:</p>

<p class="ctr vspread">NO LIFE ON MARS</p>

<p>Actually, as it happened, the
headlines were one hundred percent
correct, but they neglected to
mention, chiefly because the headline
writers didn&#8217;t know it, that
there were now two races of intelligent
life on Earth.</p>
